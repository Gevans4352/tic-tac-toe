Tic-Tac-Toe 🎉
Hey hey! Welcome to the coolest Tic-Tac-Toe game on the web no pencils, no paper, just pure finger-tapping action. Ready to flex your brain and crush your opponents? Let’s get it!

What’s This? 🤔
Tic-Tac-Toe is the classic “three in a row” game you probably played in your notebooks back in school — but now it’s online, sleek, and way more fun. Play against your friends or challenge the AI and prove who’s the real boss.

How To Play 🕹️
Pick your fighter: X or O (choose wisely, legends say X goes first 😉).

Take turns clicking on the grid to place your mark.

Get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win!

If the grid fills up and no one wins, it’s a draw but don’t cry, try again!

Features ✨
Two-player mode — challenge your IRL buddy or sibling (and humble brag about your win).

Responsive design — works on your phone, tablet, or desktop (game on the go!).

Quick resets — because losing is just a warm-up for the comeback.
