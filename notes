Steps for my game.

Enter name then select enter then the text will change to enter player 2 then player 2 will enter his name n select enter

 then the input will no longer show n only the sticks will be there, but if nothing is entered then get an alert of "name 
 
 must be filled out" else if someone put numbers or symbols then the input will not work. If all things being equal it 
 
 works then you will get an alert for player 1 to tap start following by player 2, then player 1 will then tap on 
 
 wherever he/she wants to then player 2 until there is a winner the sticks will dissapear and it will show whether player
 
  1/2 wins if it is a tie the sticks will go hidden and a messge will show "NO WINNER IN THIS ROUND" then if u want to 
  
  play again you will just start reset and follow the steps again.

  IF THE PLAYER 2 ENTERS THEIR NAME THEN HIDE FORM//
  SELECT START THEN GET A DROP DOWN: PLAYER X OR PLAYER O THEN SELECT ONE THEN WHEN YOU TAP ON A SIDE OF THE BOARD LET T
  THE ONE YOU PICK SHOW.

  WHEN YOU TAP PLAY AS X THEN WHEN YOU TAP ON A GRID IT SHOULD PLAY UNLESS THE GRID SHOULD BE DISABLE
gridItems.forEach(item => item.classList.add("disabled"));

this.playerTurn = Math.random() > 0.5 ? "X" : "O";
  window.onload = startCountdown;
      gridItems.forEach(item => item.classList.remove("disabled"));


          document.getElementById('primarybtn').addEventListener('click', () => {
        if (grid.element.classList.contains('disablegrid')) {
            grid.element.classList.remove('disablegrid');
            document.getElementById("GridParent").classList.remove('wrapper');
        }
        else {
            grid.element.classList.add('disablegrid');
            document.getElementById("GridParent").classList.add('wrapper');
        }
    });
    playerX.addEventListener("click", function () {
        playerTurn = "X";
        playerSelection.classList.add("hidden");
      });
      
      playerO.addEventListener("click", function () {
        playerTurn = "O"; 
        playerSelection.classList.add("hidden");
      });
